		"description": "Every year before Pesach, my high school would make a Haggadah in which each student would collaborate with a different Devar Torah. One year, I was tasked with designing the front cover for this school project. The front cover I designed uses a dark red primary colour to represent the four iconic cups of wine which make up an important part of the Pesach Seder. The rest of the cover is all a light silvery white which alludes to the silver which is traditionally used for the goblets holding the aforementioned four cups, as well as the white tablecloth often used for the Seder table.\n\nOverall, the simplicity of the design gives it a certain elegance which makes the hagaddah look perfectly harmonious on the Seder table.",
