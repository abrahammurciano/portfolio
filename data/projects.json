			"One year on Tisha Be-av the Youth Club in Gibraltar organized a showing of the movie Denial for the youth. Being a movie about the holocaust, I found it fitting to use a grayscale palette for the poster. Along this same theme you'll notice if you look closely, that the graphic used to divide one section of text from another is in fact some barbed wire.",
			"Additionally, you might notice that the title design has several elements giving it the style of a movie's opening sequence."

			"When a family friend wanted to start her own business, she approached me and asked me if I would like to design her business cards. Having never done any business cards before, and not knowing much about the manicure industry, I nevertheless took on the challenge.",
			"After considering several options, I settled upon a simple vector pattern using nail polish related items overlaying the solid purple background. Over this background, I placed a solid coloured ribbon upon which I could put the details necessary for the business card.",
			"For the main font, I chose something stylish with a hint of funky to write the name of the business with."

		"description": [
			"Every year before Pesach, my high school would make a Haggadah in which each student would collaborate with a different Devar Torah. One year, I was tasked with designing the front cover for this school project. The front cover I designed uses a dark red primary colour to represent the four iconic cups of wine which make up an important part of the Pesach Seder. The rest of the cover is all a light silvery white which alludes to the silver which is traditionally used for the goblets holding the aforementioned four cups, as well as the white tablecloth often used for the Seder table.",
			"Overall, the simplicity of the design gives it a certain elegance which makes the hagaddah look perfectly harmonious on the Seder table."

		"description": [
			"In the year 2020, unfortunately many communities worldwide found themselves unable to keep their synagogues open through the pandemic. In Gibraltar, there was a period of six weeks when all synagogues remained closed, and everyone found themselves unable to pray in a minyan.",
			"When this period of time came to an end, the Gibraltar Kollel started a program where people could sign up and commit to maintaining silence and respect within the synagogues during times of prayer for a month. When people signed up, they would be able to see the names of all the other people who committed.",
			"I was asked to create the website where people would be able to commit to this wonderful initiative, as well as a poster which could be hung up in the synagogue bulletin boards encouraging people to join the program.",
			"The website needed to be completed in short notice, so I made it a single page with a single input for people to submit their names on the top, followed by the list of names of those who were participating so far.",
			"A design concept which came to me early on in the planning of the website was to have an animation where the names would grow as they approached the middle of the page then shrink again as they left the screen. In order to implement this, I used plain old JavaScript and CSS.",
			"The back-end of the website was implement in some very rushed PHP. To save time, and knowing that there weren't going to be absurd amounts of participants, I skipped on storing names in a database and kept everything in a plain text file.",
			"The poster I designed for this project was very similar in style to the website. I used a dark and faded background image which was a combination of photographs from all four of Gibraltar's synagogues."

The youth organization was called 'Atid', which means future in Hebrew. They wanted the logo to incorporate this word both in Hebrew, as well as transliterated to English.",
			"For the centrepiece of the logo, I managed (after messing around with fonts and vectors for a while) to craft a sideways 'A' which was also an upright 'Ayin' â€” the first Hebrew letter of the word Atid.",
			"This centrepiece eventually also became the 'A' in the English side of the logo, which inherited the gap through all the letters from the 'A'.",
			"Although it is one of my first logo designs, it remains one of my proudest."

			"I ended up designing a round clock face design which had a sun rising over the hills in the background. On the mountains I put the word 'Zmanim' in Hebrew.",
			"When I finished my design, rather than simply using it for myself, I reached out to the developer of the app I was using, offering to contribute my improved logo design to his open source app. He gladly agreed and after some small tweaks, as well as creating a matching play store picture, his app came out with an update which included my logo design."
